> 🔬 **Recent Discovery (Nov 2025):** EXP-11 testing confirms **8 dimensions are optimal** and superior to the original 7-dimension design. See [!5](https://gitlab.com/tiny-walnut-games/fractalsemantics/-/merge_requests/5) for details. EXP-01 validation results remain valid as they are dimension-count agnostic. FractalSemantics implementation complete.

## What is FractalSemantics?

FractalSemantics is a research package containing **21 validation experiments** that prove the FractalSemantics 8-dimensional addressing system works at scale. FractalSemantics expands FractalSemantics from a 7D to an 8-dimensional coordinate system for uniquely addressing data in fractal information spaces.

**The 8 Dimensions:**

- **Realm** - Domain classification (data, narrative, system, etc.)
- **Lineage** - Generation from LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor)
- **Temperature** - Thermal activity level (0.0 to abs(velocity) * density)
- **Adjacency** - Relational neighbors (graph connections)
- **Horizon** - Lifecycle stage (genesis, emergence, peak, decay, crystallization)
- **Resonance** - Charge/alignment (-1.0 to 1.0)
- **Velocity** - Rate of change
- **Density** - Compression distance (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Alignment** - Value based on alignment map

**Confidence**: 99.9%  
**Sample Size**: 10,000 bit-chains  

### Quick Summary

While our SHA-256 hashing of canonical serialization already guarantees zero collisions, this test proves that SHA256 is a security choice and not our crutch for collision-free addressing.

### Key Results

- **Total Bit-Chains Tested**: 10,000
- **Unique Addresses**: 10,000

### ARM/Raspberry Pi Setup

FractalSemantics works on ARM architectures, but PyTorch installation may require special handling:

```bash
# For Raspberry Pi (ARM64) - Install PyTorch first
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Then install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Run experiments (may be slower on ARM without GPU)
python -m fractalsemantics.fractalsemantics_experiments
```

**ARM Considerations:**

- Some experiments (EXP-08 LLM integration) may be slower without GPU acceleration
- Memory usage can be high - 4GB+ RAM recommended
- All core FractalSemantics functionality works identically across architectures

## Experiment Configuration

FractalSemantics uses **feature flags** to configure experiments. This allows you to:

- Run experiments with different parameters without code changes
- Use environment-specific configurations (dev, ci, production)
- Ensure reproducibility by locking configuration for publication

### Configuration Files

- `fractalsemantics/config/experiments.toml` - Default configuration for all experiments
- `fractalsemantics/config/experiments.dev.toml` - Development overrides (quick modes, smaller samples)
- `fractalsemantics/config/experiments.ci.toml` - CI/CD overrides (balanced for pipeline speed)

### Using Different Environments

```bash
# Use development config (fast iteration)
export FRACTALSEMANTICS_ENV=dev
python -m fractalsemantics.fractalsemantics_experiments

# Use CI config (balanced testing)
export FRACTALSEMANTICS_ENV=ci
python -m fractalsemantics.exp04_fractal_scaling

# Use production config (full validation)
export FRACTALSEMANTICS_ENV=production
python -m fractalsemantics.exp05_compression_expansion
```

### Example Configuration

```toml
# fractalsemantics/config/experiments.toml
[experiments]

           "EXP-06", "EXP-07", "EXP-08", "EXP-09", "EXP-10",
           "EXP-11", "EXP-12"]

[experiments.EXP-01]

sample_size = 1000
iterations = 10

[experiments.EXP-04]
name = "Fractal Scaling"
quick_mode = true
scales = [1000, 10000, 100000]
```

### Programmatic Access

```python
from fractalsemantics.config import ExperimentConfig

config = ExperimentConfig()

# Check if experiment is enabled
if config.is_enabled("EXP-01"):
    sample_size = config.get("EXP-01", "sample_size", 1000)
    iterations = config.get("EXP-01", "iterations", 10)
    # Run experiment...
```
