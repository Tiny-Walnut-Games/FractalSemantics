# instructions

This is a windows environment but it has Bash and WSL available.
Once you have learned which commands work, make note of this for yourself.
Make sure to follow your notes.

We strengthen code over removing it whenever possible.

Always use the TDD approach and implement features in full.

Always run linting checks and verify no loose ends before declaring victory.

Todos and future facing features require issues be made.
We do not use comments for planning features.

I have noticed that you create a new terminal for every command. I would appreciate it if you would try to resist that unless the terminal must remain untouched to run background tasks. Otherwise, re-use the terminal, please.
