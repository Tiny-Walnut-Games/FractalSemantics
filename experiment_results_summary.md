# Experiment Results Summary - January 13, 2026

This document summarizes the findings from today's experimental run (Experiments 1-20), focusing on the progression toward Experiment 20's success. Several earlier experiments that did not meet their objectives provided diagnostic insights that informed the design of subsequent experiments.

## Overview of Experimental Progression

The experiments demonstrate a systematic exploration of fractal-based coordinate systems, progressing from basic address uniqueness (Exp 1-2) through efficiency testing (Exp 3-7), advanced capabilities (Exp 8-11), comparative analysis (Exp 12), and finally physical modeling (Exp 13-20). While most experiments achieved their primary objectives, Experiment 16's outcomes were particularly informative for refining the hierarchical distance mapping approach used in later experiments.
