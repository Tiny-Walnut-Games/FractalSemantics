CLINE: "We've proven Earth-Sun orbital mechanics derives from hierarchy without gravitational assumptions (93.8% accuracy). The next question is: Does the same hierarchical framework generalize to multi-body systems and scale across the solar system without recalibration?

Let's test this in sequence:
1. EXP-21: Earth-Moon-Sun — can we predict the Moon's 27.32-day orbital period using the exact same parameters as Earth-Sun (no tuning)?
2. EXP-22: Jupiter-Galilean Moons — if Earth-Moon works, can we discover a scaling law that makes Jupiter-moons work too?
3. EXP-23-24: Saturn rings and full solar system — test robustness across geometric complexity and N-body scale
4. EXP-25: Rogue planets and comets — prove hierarchy predicts perturbations and extreme orbital parameters

If all succeed: hierarchy is the universal organizing principle of classical mechanics.
If any fail: hierarchy needs recalibration, limiting the universality claim."
