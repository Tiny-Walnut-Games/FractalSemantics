EXP-18: Falloff Injection in Thermodynamics - Data Entities

This module contains data structures and entities for EXP-18. Since EXP-18 builds
on EXP-17's thermodynamic framework, it primarily uses the ThermodynamicState entity
from the thermodynamic validation module.

The key innovation in EXP-18 is the application of falloff injection to thermodynamic
measurements, comparing behavior with and without falloff to test whether the same
falloff mechanism that works for gravity also improves thermodynamic behavior.

Classes:
- (Uses ThermodynamicState from exp17_thermodynamic_validation)
